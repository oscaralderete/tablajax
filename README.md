# Tablajax 10th Aniversary Edition

## Render a functional data table with just a SQL query

<br>

Ten years ago I presented a resource to display a functional data table created from a mere SQL query. Those years I didn't even have a GitHub account!

Because in that days my work consisted in develop a lot of different data tables my need to get a useful tool to deploy a table as fast as possible inspired me to create Tablajax.

Sure there were some other alternatives to solve my problems in the developer community then, in that year Laravel was just a 1 year old baby so Tablajax was my own intuitive approachment to solve a critical problem for me.

Tablajax born with JavaScript columns sorting, possibility to trigger JavaScript functions, Ajax navigation and pagination... surpirse, that's why I named it Tablajax! jQuery was the React of those times so it's attached to the project.

Later versions added support to  render sub-menues, memory to display the last navigated page and a practical selector to jump to a specific page easily if you have a lot of pages available, but the core was practically the same.

This version is a refactorization, it's 100% functional but isn't practical and it doesn't meet the MVC pattern, tables aren't the preferred way to display data nowadays, if you're not a SQL pro it's really hard to use, actually before start coding for Internet I used to write database management systems with Visual FoxPro. Today anyone can extract useful data from a DB without even know SQL using ORM but those days if you couldn't write a decent SQL query you couldn't do anything else.

This repository is to celebrate 10 years of a fantastic tool a really nice piece of code. If you're a SQL guy I'm pretty sure you'll find it really interesting.
